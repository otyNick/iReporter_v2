# Project : iReporter
Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries must develop novel and localised solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of iReporter. iReporter enables any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the general public. Users can also report on things that needs government intervention

**How it works**  
A users can :
```
1. Create an account and log in
2. Create intervention -a call for a government agency to intervene- record
3. Edit or delete their red-flag or intervention records.
4. Add or edit geolocation (Lat Long Coordinates) to their red-flag or intervention records.
5. Add images or videos to their red-flag or intervention records, to support their claims.
6. Get real-time email or SMS notification when Admin changes the status of their record.
```
- Admin can change the status of a record to either  
under investigation,  
rejected (in the event of a false claim)  
or resolved (in the event that the claim has been investigated and resolved).

- The application displays a Google Map with Marker showing the red-flag or intervention location.
